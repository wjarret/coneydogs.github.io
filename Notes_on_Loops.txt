<h2>While Loops</h2>

<p>While loops are structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>while</code></li>
  <li>condition</li>
  <li>colon (<code>:</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once these conditions are followed, we can create the block of code that will run until the condition is satisfied.</p>

<pre><code>spam = 0
while spam &lt; 5:
    print('Hello, world.')
    spam = spam + 1
</code></pre>

<p>
Once the while loop is created, there are a few things to watch out for.  
First, infinite loops are created when the condition never changes, never satisfying the loop.  
This leads to the code running forever until we break (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>).
